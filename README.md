In this project, we'll analyze data from the stock market for some technology stocks. 

Again, we'll use Pandas to extract and analyze the information, visualize it, and look at different ways to analyze the risk of a stock, based on its performance history. 

Here are the questions we'll try to answer:

- What was the change in a stock's price over time?
- What was the daily return average of a stock?
- What was the moving average of various stocks?
- What was the correlation between the daily returns of different stocks?
- How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
- How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
